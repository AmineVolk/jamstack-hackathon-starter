This is a fork of https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default

to make it easier to get started using Netlify Identity and Netlify Functions with Gatsby.

Basically these are the extra dependencies you want:

- `netlify-lambda`
- `netlify-identity-widget`
- `http-proxy-middleware`

Other useful resources/reference projects that may help you:

- https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda
- https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget/tree/master/example
- [Gatsby docs on Proxying API requests in development](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/api-proxy/#advanced-proxying)

Please contact [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) if you need more help with Netlify.
